A3 Paint
This program is a project for COSC 150 with Professor Koster, called Paint.

It allows the user to draw shapes, save their shapes to a file, and load shapes from a
file. The user must select a shape before drawing it as well as select the shape's
color before drawing. If the shape is a text box, the text must be entered before
drawing as well.

Rectangles, ovals, and lines are all drawn by dragging the mouse.
Triangles are drawn by clicking three times.
Text boxes are drawn by clicking once on the screen.

For entering text to define save files, load files, or text in a text box,
the user must enter their text in the appropriate box and hit enter.

To move a shape, click and drag the appropriate location on the shape:
Rectangles - any vertex.
Oval - the very top or bottom of the oval.
Line - either end of the line.
Triangle - any vertex of the triangle.
Text box - the left end of the text box.

I worked on this project with Nico Cuevas.
