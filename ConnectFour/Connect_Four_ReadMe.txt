COSC 150 with Professor Barrett Koster
Project 2: Connect Four

ConnectFour is a package for a game of Connect Four in java.
Two players take turns placing tokens on the board with the object
of placing four in a row horizontally, diagonally, or vertically.
Tokens are colored red for the first player to place a piece and black
for the second. Each player, on his or her turn, must place a piece
in a column by clicking on the lowest available space in their selected
column. Clicking outside the board or on a space with available spaces
beneath it will not result in any pieces being played.

The code was modified from a TicTacToe program written in COSC 150 with
Professor Koster, and uses a modified game, board, player, square on the board,
and scoring system as was developed in class.
